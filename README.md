 # 👋 Hi, I’m Amrut
- I love to **create, build and tinker** - whether it's Microcontrollers, PCBs, code, script, automations, tools, ideas & whatnot. <br>
- My projects span **embedded hardware**, **open source software**, **handmade PCBs**, **FPGA/RTL**, **Python automation**, and **AI-assisted tools**
- if you find anything below interesting, feel free to reach out - I'd be happy to talk more and/or collaborate

## Workplace Tools & Engineering Initiatives
> Self-driven tools built to improve engineering workflow, efficiency,
> and turnaround time for deliverables.  
> The initiatives below had meaningful impact in day-to-day work.
> Demos available upon request.


<details>
<summary><strong>Circuit reView</strong> — Schematic visualization & cross-reference tool</summary>

**What it does**
- Reconstructs circuit connectivity using graph traversal to enable end-to-end visibility
- Allows interactive inspection of connected nets, resistors, and capacitors
- Computes total capacitance on any supply rail
- Quickly gets MCNs, descriptions, and discrete values directly from the BOM

**Impact**
- Made verification independent of fragile external tools and network dependencies
- Drastically reduced cross-reference time and manual errors
- Improved design quality across multiple deliverables

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Power DC Automation</strong> — Automated DCR simulation workflow</summary>

**What it does**
- Implements a validated, Excel-driven workflow verified in Python before simulation
- Extracts netlists from layout (SPD) files
- Verifies user-entered components and connectivity against layout data
- Ensures connectivity correctness via graph traversal
- Auto-generates TCL scripts and invokes Cadence PowerDC

**Impact**
- Reduced dependency on license availability blocking parallel work
- Cut a ~2-week, 2-engineer task down to ~2 days, single engineer
- Inspired multiple follow-on automation efforts within the team

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>S-Parameter Reduction for SoC Socket</strong> — Socket modelling for SoC power rails </summary>

**What it does**
- Processes ~2GB 3D matrix data to extract R and L values per SoC power port
- Applies S-parameter theory and numerical matrix manipulation
- Implements a custom data-reduction pipeline in Python

**Impact**
- Reduced an error-prone 6-day manual workflow to ~15 minutes
- Delivered cleaner, more repeatable results

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>RCM Crawler Automation</strong> — Guided resistive current measurement workflow</summary>

**What it does**
- Addresses long turnaround and usability issues in resistive current measurement flows
- Replaces fragile legacy tooling with a web-hosted, guided interface
- Provides step-by-step execution and review for circuit compilation and verification

**Impact**
- Reduced analysis turnaround time from >2 weeks to ~3 days
- Improved usability, clarity, and repeatability of the workflow

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>PDN Auto</strong> — Interactive PDN exploration and learning tool</summary>

**What it does**
- Computes PDN behavior via matrix manipulation of S-parameters and capacitor connectivity
- Allows interactive modification of capacitor placement
- Visualizes PDN changes to support rapid what-if analysis

**Impact**
- Enabled faster learning and intuition around capacitor placement strategies
- Improved understanding of how component size and value affect PDN behavior
